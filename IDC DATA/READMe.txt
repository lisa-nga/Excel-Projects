Business Problem
The following are some questions asked to analyze the dataset descriptively to further understand
the business problem.
 
1. Revenue Analysis:
    Calculate the total revenue for transactions where the quantity of products sold exceeds 10 units. This will help identify high volume sales.
 
2. Data Insights:
    Determine the average age of customers and identify trends in customer demographics.
    Analyse the minimum and maximum ages of customers and calculate the difference, giving insights into the age range of your customer base.

3. Precision in Financial Calculations:
    Round total revenues to the nearest whole number, down to the nearest integer, and up to the nearest integer. 
Find the number of transactions, count non-empty cells in the "Product Category" column, and calculate the standard deviation of total revenue to understand the variability in sales.
